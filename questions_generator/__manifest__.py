        A combination of an eLearning app and Automatic Question Generation. 
Automatic Question Generation (AQG) is the technique for generating a right set of questions from a content. Question Generators use trained machine learning algorithms to generate questions using some text information as the input. Given information is processed through the neural networks as a hidden step. As the output, we get questions with different variants of answers.
