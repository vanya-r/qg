    <div>A combination of an eLearning app and Automatic Question Generation.<br /><br />Automatic Question Generation (AQG) is the technique for generating a right set of questions from a content. Question Generators use trained machine learning algorithms to generate questions using some text information as the input. Given information is processed through the neural networks as a hidden step. As the output, we get questions with different variants of answers.</div>
    <div>Overview</div>
    <div>Question generation tool with pre-trained transformers (specifically seq-2-seq models) using straight-forward end-to-end methods without much complicated pipelines.</div>
    <div>Questgen is the world's most advanced question generation AI leveraging state-of-the-art transformer models like T5, BERT and OpenAI GPT-2 etc.</div>
    <div>Key tools</div>

    <div>1. Once application is installed, you can enable necessary AQG in settings. You can reach here by Configuration/Settings. It is worth paying attention to required memory capacity, as each generation tool is quite different.</div>

    <div>2. Once a user enables the generation feature in the settings, they can create the content with generated questions in it. New fields connected to generation feature pop up as a user checks the Question Generator field. Then, it is required to choose a Neural Network between the ones activated in the Settings. As a Splitter Option a user can choose a paragraph, sentence, full text or a customized one. By choosing a custom splitter, a user can identify the splitter symbol and split the text manually.</div>

    <div>3. Once a user is ready with the text, they can press the Generate button.</div>
